## 3D Spinning Cube
This project is my first Unity project. It showcases a simple spinning cube in Unity. The project taught me how to set up a basic scene and make a simple C# script in Unity and Visual Studio.

## 3D Solar System Model
A model of our solar system, made in the Unity Engine. This Project taught me about lighting and placing, resizing objects in Unity. I also got a little bit more complicated with the scripting, having all the planets rotate around the sun and on each of their axes.
